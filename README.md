Pomodoro Timer App

A simple and interactive Pomodoro Timer web app to help you stay focused and improve productivity. The app utilizes the Pomodoro Technique, which involves working in focused intervals (usually 25 minutes), followed by a short break.

Features
	•	Customizable Time Input: Allows users to set their own Pomodoro session length (hours, minutes, and seconds).
	•	Start/Pause/Reset: Users can start, pause, or reset the timer with intuitive controls.
	•	Progress Animation: Displays a visual progress bar that reflects the countdown.
	•	Sound Alerts: Play a sound alert when the Pomodoro session ends.
	•	Responsive Design: Optimized for desktop and mobile use.

Usage
	•	Start Timer: Click the “START” button or press the Space key to begin a new Pomodoro session.
	•	Pause Timer: Click the “STOP” button or press Space again to pause the timer.
	•	Reset Timer: Click the top button to reset the timer to the original input values.
	•	Keyboard Shortcuts: You can use Enter to start a session and Escape to reset if the timer is running.

How It Works
	•	The timer counts down from the time set by the user, and as time passes, the outer circle will fill up, showing the progress.
	•	When the timer reaches zero, a jingle sound is played, and the user is notified that the session has ended.
	•	The app offers intuitive interaction through both buttons and keyboard events (Space, Enter, Escape).

Customization

You can customize the timer’s appearance and behavior by modifying the following files:
	•	styles/styles.css: Change the app’s visual style (colors, layout, fonts, etc.).
	•	index.js: Adjust the timer behavior or add new features (e.g., custom alerts, additional sound effects).
